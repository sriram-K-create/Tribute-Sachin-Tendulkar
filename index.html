                             which was then the record for most runs in an edition of World Cup.</p></li>
            
            <li><p><strong>October 1996</strong> – Tendulkar captained India for the first time. </p></li>

                           in the virtual semi-final and finals against Australia.</p></li>
            
            <li><p><strong>September 1998</strong> – Sachin eclipsed Desmond Haynes’ record of most centuries in ODI cricket as

            <li><p><strong>May 1999</strong> – By his own admission, the toughest times of his career, 
                          Sachin left India’s World Cup campaign to perform the last rites of his 
                           father who had passed away in Mumbai. He showed great resilience in coming back to 
                           England and scored an unbeaten 140 in the next game he played.</p></li>
            
            <li><p><strong>February 2000</strong> –  Sachin gave up captaincy and never took it back.

                         finals where they were defeated by Australia.</p></li>
            
            <li><p><strong>January 2004</strong> – Sachin recorded his first double hundred in Australia.

                             The remarkable aspect of this innings was he did not play a single cover drive in his innings 
                             which lasted for 436 balls.</p></li>

                         Tendulkar also went past 10,000 Test runs and became only the fifth player to do so in the history of the game.</p></li>
            
            <li><p><strong>October 2005</strong> – After a career-threatening elbow injury, Tendulkar made a successful comeback to the Indian Team after nursing the ‘tennis-elbow’ and being sidelined for 6 months.
                                 He celebrated his return with a fine knock of 93 against Sri Lanka at Nagpur.</p></li>
            
            <li><p><strong>December 2005</strong> – Tendulkar went past Gavaskar’s record (34 hundreds) of the most centuries in Test cricket </p></li>

            <li><p><strong>March 2007</strong> – Tendulkar was the center of talks the moment India were knocked out of the 2007 World Cup.</p></li>
            
            <li><p><strong>January 2008 </strong>–  Sachin was at the cynosure of the ‘Monkey-Gate’ controversy. </p></li>
            
            <li><p><strong>March 2008</strong> – Sachin’s 117* and 91 in the finals helped India defeat Australia in the CB series.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>March 2012 </strong>– The Mumbaikar finally scored a century to complete 100 international centuries. </p></li>
            
            <li> <p><strong>December 2012</strong> – With 18,426 runs to his name, Sachin called time on his ODI career. </p></li>
